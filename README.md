#### Execution Instructions:
There is a makefile included for those who wish to fork the code and execute locally.
1) Navigate to the directory with the project files
2) Type "make all"
3) Type "java Crypto"

If you would like to attempt solutions for your own shift/anagram files,
either update the included .txt files in the directory, or add new .txt
files to the same locale as the others. The system is already configured
to prepend the current user directory to the file path, so when typing in file
names, only the name and extension is needed, such as "shift.txt" (sans quotations).
